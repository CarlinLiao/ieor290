    "# Social welfare functions and Arrow's impossibility theorem\n",

    "Let's talk about how we take the preferences of a set of people and turn them into a social preference. In other words, if you have a society of $m$ people who all have their own preferences on the state of the world, how can we reconcile that together into one preference: the preference of the society of these $m$ people? As a unit, what are the preferences of this society? How are compromises made?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we covered in class, a social welfare function takes in $m$ preferences and outputs $1$ preference. Arrow's impossibility theorem says that there exists no social welfare function that jointly satisfies a few desirable properties: unanimity, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ denote the finite set of outcomes that can happen. Without loss of generality, let's just call the outcomes $A = \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$. Similarly, let's name our $m$ agents $\\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below randomly generates $m$ preferences, stored in the array `agents`. For agent $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$, their preference is in `agents[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the convention that if item $x$ appears earlier (i.e. has a lower index) than item $y$, then $x$ is preferred over $y$ (i.e. $x \\succ y$). So, suppose agent $i$ has preferences $0 \\succ 2 \\succ 1$, then in an array, this would be represented as `[0 2 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we have a few cells of code to load packages, initialize variables, and define some helper functions I've provided."

    "So, let's redefine our core concepts in Arrow's impossibility theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **unanimity** means that if all $m$ agents have the same preferences, then the societal preference is the same thing. Formally, this means that for any preference $\\succ$, the social choice function satisfies $\\succ = F(\\succ, \\succ, \\dots, \\succ)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, this means for any preference `X`, if `agents[i] == X` for all `i`, then `social_welfare(agents) == agents[0] == agents[1] == ... == agents[m-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, **dictatorship** means that there exists one user who entirely determines the societal preference. Formally, there exists an $i$ such that $F(\\succ_1,\\dots,\\succ_m) = \\succ_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, this means that there exists some `i` such that `social_welfare(agents) == agents[i]` is always true, regardless of the values of `agents[.]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **independence of irrelevant alternatives** means that the relative preferences of a third option do not affect the ordering of the first two options. Formally, suppose you have one society of $m$ people $\\succ_1,\\dots,\\succ_m$, and then suppose you have a second society of $m$ different people $\\succ_1',\\dots,\\succ_m'$. If person $i$ in the first society has the same relative preference as person $i$ in the second society between outcomes $x$ and $y$, then the societal preference of the first society has the same relative preference between $x$ and $y$ as the second society. Notationally, this means that if ($x \\succ_i y$ if and only if $x \\succ_i' y$), then ($x \\succ y$ if and only if $x \\succ' y$). (Here, $\\succ = F(\\succ_1,\\dots,\\succ_m)$ and $\\succ' = F(\\succ_1',\\dots,\\succ_m')$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, can you figure out what this means in code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, find a partner in class and share your `social_welfare()` function with them. Can you find how Arrow's impossibility theorem applies? In other words, which of the 3 desiderata are violated when $n \\geq 3$?"
